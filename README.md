## 🎯 The Demo Experience

**[Resume](/) → [Demo Hub](/demo) → [Live Features](/tastemakers)**

This repository showcases three major features I built for Beli, demonstrating full-stack proficiency across mobile and web platforms. Each feature solves real user pain points in restaurant discovery and group dining coordination.

## 🚀 Features I Built

### 1. 🎭 Tastemakers
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented (Web)
**What it does**: Curated food expert profiles with specialized content and engagement tracking

**Key Highlights**:
- 13 NYC food expert profiles with diverse specialties (Pizza, Fine Dining, Vegan, Ramen, etc.)
- Comprehensive badge system (11 types) with dynamic coloring
- 12 featured articles with rich content
- Magazine-style layout with hero posts
- Full Next.js App Router implementation with dynamic routes
- Engagement metrics (followers, likes, bookmarks, views)

**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, App Router, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS

**Files**: [`beli-web/app/tastemakers/`](beli-web/app/tastemakers/)

---

### 2. 🍽️ Group Dinner / Eat Now
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented (Mobile)
**What it does**: AI-powered group dining recommendations with swipe interface and intelligent matching

**Key Highlights**:
- Tinder-style restaurant swiper with gesture controls
- 6-factor match algorithm weighing cuisine, price, ratings, distance, dietary needs, party size
- Participant search and selection
- Save up to 3 restaurants, then choose final selection
- Match breakdown showing why restaurants work for your group
- 750+ line implementation with complex state management
- Comprehensive documentation (750-line spec with algorithm details)

**Tech Stack**: React Native, Expo, TypeScript, React Navigation, Custom Animations

**Algorithm Factors**:
1. Cuisine preference compatibility
2. Price range alignment
3. Restaurant ratings
4. Distance optimization
5. Dietary restriction accommodation
6. Party size support

**Files**: [`beli-native/src/screens/GroupDinnerScreen.tsx`](beli-native/src/screens/GroupDinnerScreen.tsx), [`beli-native/src/components/group-dinner/`](beli-native/src/components/group-dinner/)

**Documentation**: [group-dinner.md](group-dinner.md)

---

### 3. 📋 What to Order
**Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented (Mobile & Web)
**What it does**: Smart menu recommendation engine based on party size and hunger level

**Key Highlights**:
- Hunger-based algorithm with point system
- Multi-step flow: Party size selection → Hunger level → AI-generated suggestions
- Smart portion sizing (Small/Medium/Large/Shareable)
- Intelligent item selection avoiding duplicates
- Share functionality with platform-specific APIs (Native Share vs Web Clipboard)
- 750+ line implementation on mobile with full modal UI
- Comprehensive 350-line feature documentation
- Animated shuffle button with smooth transitions

**Algorithm Design**:
```
Base Hunger Points = Party Size × 10 × Hunger Multiplier

Hunger Levels:
• Light: 0.8x multiplier
• Moderate: 1.2x multiplier
• Very Hungry: 1.8x multiplier

Portion Points: Small (5) | Medium (10) | Large (15) | Shareable (12)

Selection Strategy:
1. Calculate total points needed
2. Prioritize shareable items for groups
3. Mix portion sizes intelligently
4. Increase quantities instead of duplicates
5. Respect dietary restrictions
6. Balance price points
```

**Tech Stack**: React Native, Next.js, TypeScript, Platform APIs (Share/Clipboard)

**Files**:
- Mobile: [`beli-native/src/components/modals/WhatToOrderModal.tsx`](beli-native/src/components/modals/WhatToOrderModal.tsx)
- Web: [`beli-web/components/modals/what-to-order-modal.tsx`](beli-web/components/modals/what-to-order-modal.tsx)

**Documentation**: [docs/what-to-order-feature.md](docs/what-to-order-feature.md)

## 💡 Why I Built This

As someone who uses restaurant discovery apps daily and genuinely loves food culture, I wanted to demonstrate three things:

1. **Initiative**: I built features without being asked because I saw opportunities to enhance the user experience
2. **Product Thinking**: Each feature solves a real pain point I've experienced (finding credible recommendations, coordinating group dinners, menu decision paralysis)
3. **Technical Execution**: Production-quality code with comprehensive TypeScript types, error handling, documentation, and thoughtful UX

This wasn't just a coding exercise—it was about deeply understanding your product, tech stack, and users.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

- **Full-Stack Mobile Development**: Expo SDK 54, React Navigation 7, complex modal flows, gesture handling
- **Modern Web Architecture**: Next.js 15 App Router, server/client components, dynamic routing
- **Algorithm Design**: Weighted scoring systems, hunger-based recommendation logic, match algorithms
- **Design System Implementation**: Consistent theming, component libraries (shadcn/ui), responsive design
- **Platform-Specific APIs**: Native Share, Clipboard, Animation libraries
- **Documentation Culture**: Writing comprehensive specs and technical guides

## 💭 Additional Features Designed

Beyond the three implemented features, I've created comprehensive specifications for **four additional major features** (see [new-features-spec.md](new-features-spec.md)):

### 🎰 Lucky Spin
**Playful random restaurant picker** - Slot machine-style UI with smart constraint system (distance, rating, price, cuisine, open now). Solves decision paralysis with fun randomness. 40 hours estimated.

### 🗺️ Food Crawl
**Multi-restaurant adventures** - Curated routes like "NYC Pizza Pilgrimage" (4 stops) or "West Village Perfect Saturday" (5 stops). Group coordination, real-time navigation, crawl creation tools. 120 hours estimated.

### 🏆 Scavenger Hunt
**Competitive dining challenges** - Time-limited hunts like "Summer Taco Tour" (12 objectives) or "NYC Pizza Master" (15 legendary spots). Badge system, leaderboards, sponsored prizes. 160 hours estimated.

### 🆕 New Openings
**Recently opened restaurant discovery** - Time-based filtering, early adopter badges, notification system. 40 hours estimated.

**Total Specs Written**: 2,500+ lines covering data models, UI designs, user flows, algorithms, and implementation phases for ~360 hours of additional development work.
