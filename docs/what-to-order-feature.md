interface MenuItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  category: 'appetizer' | 'entree' | 'side' | 'dessert' | 'drink';
  imageUrl: string;
  portionSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'shareable';
  tags: string[];

  spiceLevel?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
}
```

### MockDataService Methods

#### `getRestaurantMenu(restaurantId: string): Promise<MenuItem[]>`
- Returns all menu items for a restaurant
- Sorts by category (appetizer ‚Üí entree ‚Üí side ‚Üí dessert ‚Üí drink)
- Secondary sort by popularity score

#### `generateOrderSuggestion(restaurantId, partySize, hungerLevel, dietaryRestrictions?): Promise<OrderSuggestion>`
- Core algorithm that creates personalized order suggestions
- Takes into account:
  - Party size (1-12 people)
  - Hunger level (light/moderate/very-hungry)
  - Optional dietary restrictions
  - Item popularity scores
  - Portion sizes

## Suggestion Algorithm

### Hunger Points System

Base calculation:
```
totalHungerPoints = partySize √ó 10 √ó hungerMultiplier

hungerMultipliers:
- light: 0.8
- moderate: 1.2
- very-hungry: 1.8
```

### Portion Points
```
small: 5 points
medium: 10 points
large: 15 points
shareable: 12 points
```

### Selection Strategy

#### Solo Dining (1 person)
- **Light**: 1 appetizer OR 1 entree
- **Moderate**: 1 entree + optional appetizer
- **Very Hungry**: appetizer + entree + dessert

#### Group Dining (2+ people)
1. **Appetizers**: `ceil(partySize / 2)` appetizers (max 1-3 based on hunger)
2. **Entrees**:
   - Light: `ceil(partySize √ó 0.5)` entrees
   - Moderate: 1 entree per person
   - Very Hungry: `partySize + floor(partySize / 3)` entrees
3. **Sides**: 0-2 sides (moderate/very-hungry only)
4. **Desserts**: `ceil(partySize / 2)` desserts (very-hungry only)
5. **Drinks**: 2 drink types √ó partySize quantity (groups of 2+)

### Item Selection Logic
- Prioritizes by popularity score (top-rated first)
- Ensures variety across categories
- Avoids duplicate items (increases quantity instead)
- Respects dietary restrictions if provided
- Adds quantity badges for duplicates

### Reasoning Generation
Auto-generated reasons based on selection:
- "Shareable starters for the table" (appetizers selected)
- "Includes crowd favorites" (high popularity items)
- "Perfect for X people" (portion matching)
- "Budget-friendly option" (< $30 per person)
- "Premium dining experience" (> $60 per person)
- "Sweet ending to your meal" (dessert included)
- "Complementary sides to share" (sides included)

## Mock Data

### Menu Coverage
Currently includes menus for:
- **Moody Tongue Pizza**: 10 items (Japanese-fusion pizza)
- **Balthazar**: 12 items (French bistro)
- Additional restaurant menus can be added to `menuItems.ts`

### Menu Item Examples
Each restaurant has:
- 2-3 appetizers
- 3-5 entrees
- 0-2 sides
- 1-2 desserts
- 1-2 drinks

### Image Sources
All food images use Unsplash with query parameters:
- Format: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-{id}?w=600&auto=format&fit=crop`
- Optimized for mobile display
- High quality, professional food photography

## UI/UX Details

### Animations
1. **Shuffle Animation**:
   - Fade out content (opacity 0.3, 150ms)
   - Rotate shuffle icon (360deg, 200ms)
   - Fade in new content (opacity 1, 150ms)

2. **Modal Transitions**:
   - Slide up animation (React Native default)
   - Page sheet presentation style
   - Smooth step transitions

### Color Scheme
- **Hunger Level Cards**:
  - Light: Green (#34C759)
  - Moderate: Orange (#FF9500)
  - Very Hungry: Red (#FF3B30)
- **Primary Actions**: Teal (#0B7B7F)
- **Success Indicators**: Green (#34C759)

### Responsive Design
- 2√ó2 grid for quick action buttons
- Wrapping enabled for smaller screens
- Minimum button width: 47%
- Consistent spacing: 12px gap

## Share Functionality

### Share Format
```
Order for [Restaurant Name]
Party of [X] ‚Ä¢ [Hunger Level]

[Quantity]√ó [Item Name] - $[Price]
[Quantity]√ó [Item Name] - $[Price]
...

Total: $[Total Price]

[Sharability Description]

Suggested by beli üçΩÔ∏è
```

### Share Channels
Uses React Native's native Share API:
- iMessage
- WhatsApp
- Email
- Notes
- Copy to clipboard
- etc.

## Error Handling

### No Menu Available
If restaurant doesn't have a menu:
- "What to Order" button is disabled
- Shows as grayed out
- No error modal needed (preventive UI)

### API Errors
- Try-catch blocks in suggestion generation
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback (loading state removed)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Menu images loaded on-demand
2. **Animation Performance**: Uses `useNativeDriver: true` where possible
3. **Delay Simulation**:
   - Menu fetch: 150ms (matches other API calls)
   - Suggestion generation: 300ms (feels like AI processing)
4. **State Management**: Local state only (no global store needed)

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
1. **Dietary Filters**: Add UI for dietary restriction toggles
2. **Favorites Integration**: Highlight items on user's favorites list
3. **Price Range Filter**: Allow users to set budget constraints
4. **Save Orders**: Let users save suggestions for later

### Long-term
1. **ML-based Suggestions**: Learn from user preferences and past orders
2. **Real Menu APIs**: Integration with restaurant POS systems
3. **Nutritional Info**: Display calories, allergens, macros
4. **Group Voting**: Allow multiple users to vote on suggestions
5. **Order Placement**: Direct integration with delivery services
6. **Photos from Friends**: Show photos from friends who've ordered these items
7. **Seasonal Menus**: Auto-update based on restaurant's seasonal offerings

## Conclusion

The "What Should I Order" feature provides a delightful, intelligent way to help users make dining decisions. The smart algorithm considers multiple factors to create balanced, appropriate suggestions while the beautiful UI makes the experience enjoyable. With proper menu data and future ML integration, this could become a core value proposition for the beli app.
